# prisma

## Purpose

`prisma` owns the persisted annotation-domain model, migrations, and seed scripts.

## Important Files

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - current database schema.
- `prisma/migrations/20260519213000_annotation_domain_baseline/migration.sql` - current development baseline migration.
- `prisma/seed.ts` and `prisma/seed.mjs` - local seed scripts.
- `prisma.config.ts` - Prisma config and environment loading.

## Public Interfaces / Routes / Functions

- Prisma Client is generated with `npx prisma generate`.
- Application DB access goes through `src/server/db.ts`.

## Invariants And Constraints

- Schema changes require docs and tests.
- This repository is still in development stage; local data may be destroyed and the migration baseline may be reset when it removes prototype debt.
- Raw images and mask versions must remain attributable and integrity-checked before database commit where practical.
- Approved mask versions and exports must be append-only and reproducible from stored checksums, dimensions, metadata, review state, and exact version references.

## Known Gaps

- Project/image metadata, default slice support/classification, review, export, and upload/artifact validation workflows exist for the MVP path.
- Slice-specific metadata, multi-slice editing, advanced export policy, and prediction import remain deferred.
- `MaskKind.REFINED` has been removed from the active schema.
